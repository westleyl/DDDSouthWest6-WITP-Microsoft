## What is the point of … Microsoft? ##

The demise of Microsoft has been predicted by many; Microsoft as a platform for software and specifically their development tools and ecosystem.  So what is their relevance for developers over the next five years?  Can’t we just write stuff in Ruby and Node with web clients in JavaScript, and mobile clients in Objective-C, Swift and Java?

The reboot of Microsoft has been dramatic over the past few years, embracing OSS, ASP.NET vNext rewriting the core of what .NET represents, and the final promise of deployment to any platform.  Their support for Xamarin provides a cross platform mobile solution, and Azure can survive without a Windows Server in sight.

Liam will take a subjective stroll through where Microsoft is heading, and what the changes might mean for existing Microsoft developers.

There will be time at the end to have an audience discussion, and take a vote on whether they believe they’ll be developing with Microsoft tools in 2020.
